My research interest lies mainly at the intersection of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (specifically in Machine Comprehension). Due to my keen interest in NLP, I have also chosen to do a stream project (a two-year-long project for B.Tech. Honors) on Automatic Question Answering Sytems.

I have previously been involved in several research projects in Natural Language Processing, Sequence Modeling and Deep Learning. I am currently working on Question answering with SQUAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) using deep neural networks coupled with attention mechanism. 
I have previously worked on Context-Based Question Answering System (for Tourism Domain) as a summer project under Prof. Rajeev Sangal (Director, IIT-BHU) and Prof. Anil Kumar Singh and I am currently extending it in my stream project to improve the system performance. I have also worked on sequence modeling using Deep Learning approaches for Language Modeling (Text generation using PTB Data), and Time Series Prediction. 
By working in these projects, I learnt how to approach challenging problems. I also developed good collaboration skills by doing teamwork.

In the duration of internship I will contribute to the on-going project “Community-based Question Answering	for	Educational	Information” (QAEduInf) in Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt. This project aims to automate question answering on various educational topics by using the data collected from the web in the form of Question  Answer pairs. My work will concentrate on paraphrase recognition and information retrieval component of the system to find answers to the questions posted by the user. This project highly aligns with my research interests and my previous projects so the skills that I developed till now would definitely help me to come up with productive research at UKP Lab.

I aim to be a full-time researcher and I am passionate about making best of my contributions to NLP by working on Machine Comprehension Systems. I am also interested in pursuing MS/Ph.D. in NLP right after my Bachelors.

TU Darmstadt is well known for its pioneering achievements and outstanding research, and it holds an excellent reputation among the leading institutes of Technology in Germany. It has a very strong research base with profound scientists. Working with highly experienced people at UKP Lab will surely help me in gaining invaluable experience in Deep Learning and NLP, and also will help me to enhance my interpersonal skills. I sincerely believe that with my hard work and dedication I will be able to contribute meaningfully to the projects at Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt.

I like to work on research problems lying at the intersection of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (especially in Machine Comprehension). Along with my bachelors in computer science, I am doing honors in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Automatic Question Answering Systems.

I have previously been involved in several research projects in Natural Language Processing, Sequence Modeling and Deep Learning. I worked on Context-Based Question Answering System (for Tourism Domain) as a summer project under Prof. Rajeev Sangal (Director, IIT-BHU) and Prof. Anil Kumar Singh and I am currently extending it in my stream project to improve the system performance. In this project I worked on utilizing unstructured information given in form of textual data and converted it to a structured form of data for Answering user's question on Tourism. 
I have also worked on Time Series Prediction for software bugs using recurrent neural networks and co-authored a paper on this project under the guidance of Prof. K.K. Shukla. I also experimented with Deep Learning approaches for Language-Modeling (Text generation using PTB Data).

Currently, I am working on Question answering with SQUAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) using deep neural networks coupled with attention mechanism. Being involved in all these projects has helped me learn how to approach challenging problems, understand the process of research and the scientific rigour involved in coming up with good contributions, and develop collaboration skills along with the technical experience. 

Apart from these projects my performance with my coursework has been reasonably well with CGPA: 9.06/10.00 . Also I was awarded A* grade for outstanding performance in Artificial Intelligence course. Additionally, I am an active member of Student NLP Group at IIT BHU where discussions are carried out on topics which have not been taught in the course. 

In the duration of internship I would be contribute to the on-going project “Community-based Question Answering	for	Educational	Information” (QAEduInf) in Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt. This project aims to automate question answering on various educational topics by using the data collected from the web in the form of Question Answer pairs. My work will concentrate on paraphrase recognition and information retrieval component of the system to find answers to the questions posted by the user. This project aligns with my research interests and my previous projects so the skills that I developed till now would definitely help me to come up with productive research at UKP Lab.

I aim to make research my career and want to make high-quality contributions in machine comprehension. I plan to do graduate studies focusing on NLP after my Bachelors.

TU Darmstadt is well known for its pioneering achievements and outstanding research, especially in Natural Language Processing. In an environment full of experienced people, active learners and creative ideas, The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab at TU Darmstadt will help me further gauge my interest in Question Answering Research. I sincerely believe that my past experience combined with my sincerity and desire to do research will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the projects at Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt. 



Project Description

In the duration of internship I will be contributing to the on-going project "Community-based Question Answering for Educational Information (QAEduInf)" in Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt. This project aims to automate question answering on various educational topics by utilizing the data collected from the web in the form of Question Answer pairs. 
Although today there is a lot of information present on the web, but benefiting from them is not always easy for the users. They need to go through various web pages individually, which needs a lot of user effort. An automatic question answering system which analyzes reliable information present on the web will significantly reduce users effort.
My work will concentrate on paraphrase recognition and information retrieval component of the system to find answers to the questions posted by the user. After user asks the question, this component of the system uses paraphrase recognition and information retrieval techniques to search for similar questions that have already been asked on various community-based QA sites because their answer are potentially the answers to the newly posted question.
